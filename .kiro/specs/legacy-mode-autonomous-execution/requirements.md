# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Legacy Mode Autonomous Execution feature enables the VSCode extension to handle large and complex functionality implementations through an autonomous loop of planning, execution, and verification. This mode breaks down complex tasks into manageable TODOs, maintains context across multiple LLM calls, and uses structured JSON communication to coordinate between the LLM, parser, and execution tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to autonomously execute complex tasks by breaking them into smaller TODOs, so that I can complete large implementations without manual intervention at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates Legacy Mode with a complex task THEN the system SHALL analyze the task and break it into smaller, manageable TODOs
2. WHEN TODOs are created THEN each TODO SHALL include a description and expected result/goal
3. WHEN executing TODOs THEN the system SHALL maintain context between calls to ensure smooth execution
4. WHEN all TODOs are completed THEN the system SHALL stop the autonomous loop and confirm completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to manage TODOs with clear status tracking, so that I can understand progress and verify completion of each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TODO is created THEN it SHALL have a status of "pending"
2. WHEN a TODO is completed THEN the system SHALL ask the LLM for confirmation if the result is acceptable
3. IF the LLM confirms the result is acceptable THEN the system SHALL mark the TODO as "done" and move to the next
4. IF the LLM indicates the result is not acceptable THEN the system SHALL retry or adjust based on feedback
5. WHEN displaying TODOs in chat THEN the template SHALL show description, expected result, and status (pending/done)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use structured JSON communication, so that the LLM responses can be reliably parsed and executed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM responds THEN it SHALL use a structured JSON format defined by the mode
2. WHEN parsing the JSON response THEN the parser SHALL verify it's valid JSON by accessing all expected values
3. IF any values are missing from the JSON THEN the parser SHALL place placeholders and pass to the route file
4. WHEN the route file processes the request THEN it SHALL return the message to be shown in chat view
5. WHEN tool calling is required THEN it SHALL be performed behind the scenes by the route file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tooling support for file operations and terminal commands, so that the autonomous mode can perform all necessary development tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations are needed THEN the system SHALL support file search using VSCode's built-in APIs
2. WHEN file modifications are required THEN the system SHALL support file editing and patching tools
3. WHEN new files are needed THEN the system SHALL support file creation tools
4. WHEN system commands are required THEN the system SHALL support terminal command execution
5. WHEN managing TODOs THEN the system SHALL support TODO creation, updating, and completion operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper context management across multiple LLM calls, so that the system always knows the current state and what needs to be done next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making LLM calls THEN the system SHALL provide all necessary context including previous actions
2. WHEN maintaining state THEN the system SHALL track current TODO status
3. WHEN continuing execution THEN the system SHALL know what has been completed
4. WHEN planning next steps THEN the system SHALL know what needs to be done next
5. WHEN using client API calls THEN the system SHALL provide fresh context on every call since calls are stateless

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear chat display templates for different operations, so that I can easily understand what the system is doing and track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing terminal commands THEN the system SHALL show the command being executed and its result
2. WHEN displaying TODOs THEN the system SHALL show description, expected result, and status using a structured template
3. WHEN making tool calls THEN the system SHALL indicate which tool is being used with inputs and outputs
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error message, context about which tool failed, and suggested next steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling throughout the autonomous execution, so that failures are gracefully managed and recovery options are provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any tool fails THEN the system SHALL have proper error handling
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be clearly reported in chat with error message and context
3. WHEN tool failures happen THEN the system SHALL suggest next steps (retry, adjust input, skip, etc.)
4. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with placeholders
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and recovery options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow a structured execution flow, so that complex tasks are completed systematically and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a main task THEN the LLM SHALL analyze and break it into TODOs
2. WHEN TODOs are created THEN the system SHALL confirm the TODO plan with structured display
3. WHEN executing TODOs THEN the system SHALL use tools and confirm completion before moving to next
4. WHEN all TODOs are complete THEN the system SHALL stop the loop once LLM confirms task is fully complete
5. WHEN file editing is requested THEN the system SHALL be able to edit files, add lines, and save changes with proper context
