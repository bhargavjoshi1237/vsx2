# Chat Router System Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive router system that handles message routing, model management, and different chat modes for the VSX extension.

## Architecture

### üîÑ Router (`router.js`)
The main router class that manages:
- **Message Routing**: Routes user messages to appropriate handlers
- **Model Management**: Lists and manages available AI models
- **Mode System**: Implements different chat modes (Ask, Legacy, Edit)

### ü§ñ AI Clients (`clients/`)
Modular client system for different AI services:

#### **Gemini Client** (`clients/geminiClient.js`)
- Google Gemini API integration
- Multiple model support (Gemini Pro, Gemini Pro Vision, Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- Simulated responses for testing without API key
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

#### **Example Client** (`clients/exampleClient.js`)
- Template for creating new AI clients
- Shows the required interface and methods
- Ready to be customized for other AI services

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`config.js`)
Centralized configuration for:
- API keys and endpoints
- Model settings and parameters
- Client-specific configurations

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Message Routing System**
```javascript
// Route user message through the system
const response = await router.routeMessage(message, model, mode);
```

### 2. **Model Management**
```javascript
// Get all available models from all clients
const models = router.getModels();
// Returns: { clients: {...}, flatList: [...] }
```

### 3. **Mode System**
- **Ask Mode**: ‚úÖ Implemented - Simple Q&A functionality
- **Legacy Mode**: üöß Structure ready, implementation pending
- **Edit Mode**: üöß Structure ready, implementation pending

### 4. **Dynamic Model Selection**
- Automatically detects which client supports which model
- Updates statistics display with real model information
- Integrates with existing dropdown system

## File Structure
# Router and Clients Removed

The router system (`ui/router.js`) and the AI client implementations in `ui/clients/` have been removed from this project.

- **What changed:** The previous router and client subsystem was neutralized and deleted. The extension now uses local fallback logic in `ui/chatHandler.js` and inline UI components instead of routing through `router.js`.
- **If you relied on the old system:** Reintroduce a router or client implementations by creating new files in `ui/clients/` and restoring a `ui/router.js` that aggregates them.
- **Testing:** Open the extension and verify chat flows; `ui/chatHandler.js` provides fallback behavior when no external clients are present.

If you want me to restore or re-implement a router/client system, tell me which providers to add and I'll scaffold them.
